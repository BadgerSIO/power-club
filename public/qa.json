    "question": "How does react work?",

    "question": "What is the difference between props and state in React component?",
    "answer": "Simply put, State is the local state of the component which cannot be accessed and modified outside of the component. It's equivalent to local variables in a function. Props, on the other hand, make components reusable by giving components the ability to receive data from their parent component in the form of props."
